            <p>HeartX, a Web3.0 art trading marketplace and community platform, is set to change the game for the art market. The team just announced their pre-launch Vote-to-Earn Game is live now. This new experience allows users to earn tokens ($HNX) through voting on artwork pieces by swiping right or left as Like and Next, giving them a chance to engage with the core feature of the platform in advance and get rewarded from showing their preferences on the arts.</p>
            <p>The immersive Vote-to-Earn game is a clear demonstration of the platform's user-centric design, letting people experience the X-to-Earn model in an easier way. By leveraging blockchain technology, HeartX is creating a platform that is more user-friendly, transparent, and entertaining than anything that has come before. Through the Vote-to-Earn system, HeartX is committed to redefine the value of arts by the community consensus with the heart.</p>

            <p>“We're all excited about it! All users can earn tokens by ‘swiping’ to vote," said HeartX founder Anson. "We believe that it's important to make it more engaging for people and reward them for being part of our community. And through the forming of the community consensus, we would establish a new valuation standard for the artwork pieces."</p>

            <p>It is simple to play the game: users can earn tokens by voting on the daily artwork pieces on the event website, no log-in or registration needed, just swipe/click right to show that you like, or left to show the next one. The rewarding tokens $HNX can be used in various scenarios once the marketplace is launched, including investing in your preferred artwork pieces to boost them, and accessing premium features.</p>

            <p>The HeartX team also announced that during the "Vote-to-Earn" campaign, users who have accumulated more voting works that reached a consensus on community aesthetic views will have the opportunity to participate the beta testing experience when the HeartX App is launched.</p>
            <p>Gathering influencers in not only web3 but also digital art space, the Vote-to-Earn game is a beginning that is just one example of the many innovative features that the HeartX team has planned for their users.  HeartX's vision for the future of digital art goes beyond being an online marketplace. The team keeps working to create a marketplace that leverages the power of blockchain technology and to provide a binding community for users. Another current update is, HeartX token “$HNX” is now available on Uniswap, if the $HNX you get is not satisfying, you can also get it from Uniswap and more DEX (Decentralized Exchanges) in a short time! “With the project moving forward, we believe that more people will come and form a large community, and they are eager to be part of the next big thing in Web3.0”, said the HeartX team.</p>
